## Lactate Threshold Workouts

## VO2 Max Workouts
### VO2-W2
**50 Seconds Of Pain**
This is 3x12-minute sets of 50 seconds all-out (125% FTP) followed closely by 50 seconds of rest where the less predictable spacing of efforts is meant to surprise riders & keep them attentive.

4 minutes of recovery separates each set of intervals.

The primary aim is to Improve maximum aerobic capacity, i.e. endurance that allows riders to work harder & longer with less sugar-expense and improved oxygen utilisation.

Secondarily, this strives to simultaneously challenge one's anaerobic work capacity leading to greater speed endurance, improved lactate processing & sprint capabilities.
