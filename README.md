## Active Recovery Workouts <a id="ar"></a>

---

### AR-W1

**Active recovery**

Simple ride that should be kept under 75% of FTP

Section   | Time | Description | Zones | % of FTP
----------|------|-------------|:-----:|:-------:
Warmup    | 10m  | Easy riding | 2     | 38-66
Main set  | 45m  | Easy riding | <2    | 0-75
Cool down | 5m   | Cool down   | 2     | 29-55

---

## Endurance Workouts

---

### END-W1

**Active recovery**

Warm up and ride at a nice, steady pace.

Keep cadence high, 85-95rpm. Occasional hills might increase your power, but generally average between 56 and 75 percent of FTP.

Cool down

Cool down | 5m   | Cool down   | 2     | 29-55

---

### END-W2

**Basic ride**

Warm up to get the legs loose.

Keep cadence high, 85-95rpm. Power should not exceed 80 percent of FTP. It's okay if power tips past 80 percent on the occasional hill, but keep the ride focused on building endurance.

Cool down with easy pedalling

Section   | Time | Description | Zones | % of FTP
----------|------|-------------|:-----:|:-------:
Warmup    | 10m  | Easy riding | 2     | 38-66
Main set  | 90m  | Endurance   | 2     | 66-75
Cool down | 5m   | Cool down   | 2     | 29-55

---

### END-W3

**Longer Basic Ride**

This ride will extend your milage slightly and build your 'engine'. Solid endurance/tempo miles will improve your aerobic capacity.

After warming up, ride for about 2.5 hours with power between 60 and 70 percent of FTP and cadence in the 90-95 rpm range. At times this is an easy effort, and other times it's a solid fast pace. Try not to spend much time over 70 percent of FTP.

Cool down with 10-15 minutes of easy riding before making that recovery shake and stretching.

Section   | Time | Description | Zones | % of FTP
----------|------|-------------|:-----:|:-------:
Warmup    | 10m  | Easy riding | 2     | 38-66
Main set  | 150m | Endurance   | 2     | 66-75
Cool down | 5m   | Cool down   | 2     | 29-55

---

### END-W4

**10 Second Bursts**

Warm up in the usual manor.

Then begin 2.5 hours of riding at a nice, steady pace with watts in levels 2-3. This is great endurance pace that will allow you to finish strong and also get some solid aerobic benefit. Within the endurance set do ten short ten second bursts out of the saddle. This burst effort is 80 percent of what a full point would be. Cadence should be high, over 105 rpm to create a hard, sharp effort that will begin to improve your neuromuscular capacity. Do these bursts randomly throughout the ride.

Cool down

## Sweet spot Workouts

---

### SS-W6

**Six minute spots**

Sweet spot training is some of your best bang for buck. It offers great metabolic advantages whilst still be repeatable many times in the week. Sweet spot training takes place just below your threshold and can take the form of many lengths of intervals.

This particular work out is for 3 sets of 6 minute intervals.

Section   | Time         | Description           | Zones | % of FTP
----------|--------------|-----------------------|:-----:|:-------:
Warmup    | 10m          | Easy riding           | 2     | 38-66

### SS-W8

**Twelve minute spots**

Sweet spot training is some of your best bang for buck. It offers great metabolic advantages whilst still be repeatable many times in the week. Sweet spot training takes place just below your threshold and can take the form of many lengths of intervals.

This particular work out is for 3 sets of 12 minute intervals.

Start with 10 minutes of warm up followed by 5 sets of 1 minute fast pedalling. 1 minutes rest inbetween efforts.

Perform the 3 sets of 12 minutes at sweet spot effort with 3 minutes zone 2 recovery.

Cool down for 5 minutes

## Lactate Threshold Workouts

---

### LT-W9

**Rubicon**

Rubicon consists of 3x12-minute intervals at 105% FTP with 6-minute recoveries between intervals.

The goal of Threshold workouts is to extend high power over greater duration so each iteration of this particular type of suffering will include more or longer work intervals than the version before it and the recovery valleys will shrink from training phase to training phase.

These intervals are also an ideal time to begin bridging the gap between power in an upright riding position and power in an aerodynamic position.

Strive your keep your cadence in that 85-95 rpm range.

Section   | Time          | Description           | Zones | % of FTP
----------|---------------|-----------------------|:-----:|:-------:
Warmup    | 10m           | Easy riding           | 2     | 38-66

## VO2 Max Workouts

---

### VO2-W2

**50 seconds of pain**

This is 3x12-minute sets of 50 seconds all-out (125% FTP) followed closely by 50 seconds of rest where the less predictable spacing of efforts is meant to surprise riders & keep them attentive.

4 minutes of recovery separates each set of intervals.

The primary aim is to Improve maximum aerobic capacity, i.e. endurance that allows riders to work harder & longer with less sugar-expense and improved oxygen utilisation.

Secondarily, this strives to simultaneously challenge one's anaerobic work capacity leading to greater speed endurance, improved lactate processing & sprint capabilities.

---

### VO2-W3

**Sprint and hold**

This is 6 sets lasting almost 5 minutes each each consisting of 8x15 efforts at 125% FTP with less than restful "floats" for 15 seconds at 88% FTP.The floats grow to 30 seconds after every set of short VO2 Max efforts.Recoveries between sets are 5 minutes long.

The goal here is to improve both your aerobic efficiency and aerobic power.By working very hard for brief intervals and then only recovering for very short periods of time, these microintervals can be highly effective at improving your ability to sustain & repeat efforts well above FTP.This improved aerobic capacity & power can also raise your sustainable power and gradually increase your FTP.Additionally, youll improve your ability to accelerate in minimal time and improvements in your mental capacity (i.e. toughness) are likely considering the necessary discomfort when repeating high-intensity bursts of power & speed.Very Important: Performing these intervals at 125% FTP assumes you can complete the intervals with few or no breaks.If youre frequently exiting intervals early, reduce the Workout Intensity to a repeatable power output.

Section   | Time         | Description           | Zones | % of FTP
----------|--------------|-----------------------|:-----:|:-------:
Warmup    | 10m          | Easy riding           | 2     | 38-66
VO2       | 3x5m (5m RI) | VO2 Max efforts       | 5     | 110-120
Cool down | 5m           | Cool down             | 2     | 29-55

---

### VO2-W8

**Red Lake**

Red Lake is 5x6-minute repeats at 108% FTP separated by 5-minute recovery valleys.

A sharp drop from VO2 Max power allows far greater time at an output well above your current sustainable power.

The intent is to cultivate greater muscular endurance and pain tolerance as your VO2 Max intervals become more & more similar to your key event.

Shoot for a cadence in the 85-95 rpm range.

Section   | Time         | Description           | Zones | % of FTP
----------|--------------|-----------------------|:-----:|:-------:
Warmup    | 10m          | Easy riding           | 2     | 38-66
VO2       | 5x6m (5m RI) | VO2 Max efforts       | 5     | 108
Cool down | 5m           | Cool down             | 2     | 29-55

---

### VO2-W9

**Shortoff**

Shortoff consists of 2 sets of 3x2-minute VO2 Max intervals at 120% FTP.

Rest between intervals is 2 minutes long and rest between sets of intervals is 8 minutes long.

Reduce the Workout Intensity as necessary such that you can fully complete each of these 4-minute intervals, but never drop below 110% FTP.

You''ll then probably use that same power reduction during alternate versions of this workout which increase each interval's duration.

VO2max repeats are all about increasing your aerobic capabilities & adaptations via work done at or very near your peak aerobic power output.

On the psychological side, they'll improve your ability to not only mentally tolerate work at this high output but repeat such efforts, frequently if necessary.

Section   | Time         | Description           | Zones | % of FTP
----------|--------------|-----------------------|:-----:|:-------:
Warmup    | 10m          | Easy riding           | 2     | 38-66
Endurance | 5m           | Easy riding           | 2     | 59-68

Recovery  | 8m           | Easy riding           | 1     | 40
Set 2     | 3x4m (4m RI) | VO2 Max efforts       | 5     | 120
Cool down | 5m           | Cool down             | 2     | 29-55

## Anaerobic Capacity Workouts

---

### AC-W9

**Monadnock**

Monadnock consists of 2 sets of 3x4-minute VO2max intervals at 130% FTP.

Rest between intervals is 4 minutes long and rest between sets of intervals is 8 minutes long.

Reduce the Workout Intensity as necessary such that you can fully complete each of these 4-minute intervals, but never drop below 110% FTP.

You''ll then probably use that same power reduction during alternate versions of this workout which increase each interval's duration.

### AC-W12

**Hawks Bill**

Hawk's Bill is 6 sets of 7x 20s/15s Reduced Amplitude Billats where you'll spend 20 seconds at 125% FTP and then "float" for 15 seconds at 88% FTP.

Extended 30-second floats fall after each set of Billats and the entire workout offers a crack at almost 12 minutes at/near VO2 Max power.

5 minutes of recovery separate each set.

As with similar workouts, the goal is to improve both your aerobic efficiency and aerobic power.

By working very hard for brief intervals and then only recovering for very short periods of time, these microintervals can be highly effective at improving your ability to sustain & repeat efforts well above FTP.

This improved aerobic capacity & power can also raise your sustainable power and gradually increase your FTP.

Additionally, you'll improve your ability to accelerate in minimal time and improvements in your mental capacity (i.e. toughness) are likely considering the necessary discomfort when repeating high-intensity bursts of power & speed.

Very Important: Performing these intervals at 125% FTP assumes you can complete the intervals with few or no breaks.

### AC-W16

**Apple Orchard**

Apple Orchard is 4 sets lasting 3.5 minutes each. Each interval consists of 6x15 efforts at 125% FTP with less than restful "floats" for 15 seconds at 88% FTP.

The floats grow to 30 seconds after every set of short VO2 Max efforts.

Recoveries between sets are 3 minutes long.

The primary goals here are still to improve both your aerobic efficiency & aerobic power, but by keeping the total work volume relatively low with fewer repeats, your body stands a better chance of absorbing the stress of previous, higher-stress training weeks.
