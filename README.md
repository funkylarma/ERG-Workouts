# ERG Workouts

---

This is a collection of workouts I have created or found through various channels.

These workouts are broken down by the power zones they target.

- Active Recovery Workouts
- Endurance Workouts
- Tempo Workouts
- Sweet spot Workouts
- Lactate Threshold Workouts
- VO2 Max Workouts
- Anaerobic Capacity Workouts
- Neuromuscular Workouts
- Testing Protocols

## Active Recovery Workouts

---

### AR-W1
**Active recovery**

Simple ride that should be kept under 75% of FTP

---

## Endurance Workouts

---

### END-W3
**Longer Basic Ride**

This ride will extend your milage slightly and build your 'engine'. Solid endurance/tempo miles will improve your aerobic capacity.

After warming up, ride for about 2.5 hours with power between 60 and 70 percent of FTP and cadence in the 90-95 rpm range. At times this is an easy effort, and other times it's a solid fast pace. Try not to spend much time over 70 percent of FTP.

Cool down with 10-15 minutes of easy riding before making that recovery shake and stretching.

### END-W4
**10 Second Bursts**

Warm up in the usual manor.

Then begin 2.5 hours of riding at a nice, steady pace with watts in levels 2-3. This is great endurance pace that will allow you to finish strong and also get some solid aerobic benefit. Within the endurance set do ten short ten second bursts out of the saddle. This burst effort is 80 percent of what a full point would be. Cadence should be high, over 105 rpm to create a hard, sharp effort that will begin to improve your neuromuscular capacity. Do these bursts randomly throughout the ride.

Cool down

## Tempo Workouts

---

## Sweet spot Workouts

---

### SS-W6
**Six minute spots**

---

## Lactate Threshold Workouts

---

## VO2 Max Workouts

---

### VO2-W2
**50 seconds of pain**

This is 3x12-minute sets of 50 seconds all-out (125% FTP) followed closely by 50 seconds of rest where the less predictable spacing of efforts is meant to surprise riders & keep them attentive.

4 minutes of recovery separates each set of intervals.

The primary aim is to Improve maximum aerobic capacity, i.e. endurance that allows riders to work harder & longer with less sugar-expense and improved oxygen utilisation.

Secondarily, this strives to simultaneously challenge one's anaerobic work capacity leading to greater speed endurance, improved lactate processing & sprint capabilities.

### VO2-W3
**Sprint and hold**

This is 6 sets lasting almost 5 minutes each each consisting of 8x15 efforts at 125% FTP with less than restful "floats" for 15 seconds at 88% FTP.The floats grow to 30 seconds after every set of short VO2 Max efforts.Recoveries between sets are 5 minutes long.

The goal here is to improve both your aerobic efficiency and aerobic power.By working very hard for brief intervals and then only recovering for very short periods of time, these microintervals can be highly effective at improving your ability to sustain & repeat efforts well above FTP.This improved aerobic capacity & power can also raise your sustainable power and gradually increase your FTP.Additionally, youll improve your ability to accelerate in minimal time and improvements in your mental capacity (i.e. toughness) are likely considering the necessary discomfort when repeating high-intensity bursts of power & speed.Very Important: Performing these intervals at 125% FTP assumes you can complete the intervals with few or no breaks.If youre frequently exiting intervals early, reduce the Workout Intensity to a repeatable power output.

## Testing Protocols

### TEST-W1

**20 Minute FTP Test**

This is the normal Hunter Allan and Andrew Coggan 20 minute FTP test.
