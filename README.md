## Active Recovery Workouts

---

### AR-W1

**Active recovery**

Simple ride that should be kept under 75% of FTP

Section   | Time | Description | Zones | % of FTP
----------|------|-------------|:-----:|:-------:
Warmup    | 10m  | Easy riding | 2     | 38-66
Main set  | 45m  | Easy riding | <2    | 0-75
Cool down | 5m   | Cool down   | 2     | 29-55

---

## Endurance Workouts

---

### END-W1

**Active recovery**

Warm up and ride at a nice, steady pace.

Keep cadence high, 85-95rpm. Occasional hills might increase your power, but generally average between 56 and 75 percent of FTP.

Cool down

### END-W2

**Basic ride**

Warm up to get the legs loose.

Keep cadence high, 85-95rpm. Power should not exceed 80 percent of FTP. It's okay if power tips past 80 percent on the occasional hill, but keep the ride focused on building endurance.

Cool down with easy pedalling

Cool down | 5m   | Cool down   | 2     | 29-55

---

### END-W3

**Longer Basic Ride**

This ride will extend your milage slightly and build your 'engine'. Solid endurance/tempo miles will improve your aerobic capacity.

After warming up, ride for about 2.5 hours with power between 60 and 70 percent of FTP and cadence in the 90-95 rpm range. At times this is an easy effort, and other times it's a solid fast pace. Try not to spend much time over 70 percent of FTP.

Cool down with 10-15 minutes of easy riding before making that recovery shake and stretching.

---

### END-W4

**10 Second Bursts**

Warm up in the usual manor.

Then begin 2.5 hours of riding at a nice, steady pace with watts in levels 2-3. This is great endurance pace that will allow you to finish strong and also get some solid aerobic benefit. Within the endurance set do ten short ten second bursts out of the saddle. This burst effort is 80 percent of what a full point would be. Cadence should be high, over 105 rpm to create a hard, sharp effort that will begin to improve your neuromuscular capacity. Do these bursts randomly throughout the ride.

## Sweet spot Workouts

---

### SS-W6

**Six minute spots**

Sweet spot training is some of your best bang for buck. It offers great metabolic advantages whilst still be repeatable many times in the week. Sweet spot training takes place just below your threshold and can take the form of many lengths of intervals.

This particular work out is for 3 sets of 6 minute intervals.

### SS-W8

**Twelve minute spots**

Sweet spot training is some of your best bang for buck. It offers great metabolic advantages whilst still be repeatable many times in the week. Sweet spot training takes place just below your threshold and can take the form of many lengths of intervals.

This particular work out is for 3 sets of 12 minute intervals.

Start with 10 minutes of warm up followed by 5 sets of 1 minute fast pedalling. 1 minutes rest in-between efforts.

Perform the 3 sets of 12 minutes at sweet spot effort with 3 minutes zone 2 recovery.

Cool down for 5 minutes

### SS-W10

**Crane**

Crane is 5x30-second Hard Starts at 165% FTP followed by 1 minute of Sweet Spot work at 92% FTP.

Nearly 5 minutes of recovery falls between each effort.

Since each of these short, race-priming efforts targets increased muscle activation, make each of them matter by perfecting your ability to hammer yourself without breaking yourself.

You'll know you've gone too hard when you can't survive the post-sprint minute, and you might need to increase the Workout Intensity if you find yourself sailing through those final minutes.

## Lactate Threshold Workouts

---

### LT-W8

**Mixed Up Minutes**

Warm up as normal and follow this up with a couple of minutes of fast pedal.

The main part of this workout consists of 4 sets of 5 minutes at various zones. Start with 1 minute at VO2 Max, second minute at Threshold. Third minute you get to relax at Tempo before you build back up to Threshold for the 4th minute. Finish the 5th and final minute at VO2 Max and finally rest for 7 minutes.

Finish the workout with a 5 minute cool down.

### LT-W9

**Rubicon**

Rubicon consists of 3x12-minute intervals at 105% FTP with 6-minute recoveries between intervals.

The goal of Threshold workouts is to extend high power over greater duration so each iteration of this particular type of suffering will include more or longer work intervals than the version before it and the recovery valleys will shrink from training phase to training phase.

These intervals are also an ideal time to begin bridging the gap between power in an upright riding position and power in an aerodynamic position.

Strive your keep your cadence in that 85-95 rpm range.

### LT-W10

**Truuli**

This priming workout for a time trial or road race is recommended 24 hours prior to your TT.

It includes 3x4-minute steady-state efforts @ FTP & three 90-second blowout efforts at 115-125% FTP.

Modifications: 45-minute version

It's important to blow out your legs to a certain extent the day prior to a time trial or road race.

Give yourself adequate recovery between efforts and stay hydrated & nourished, and definitely have a recovery immediately post-workout.

### LT-W11

**Sisters**

Sisters consists of 3x6-minute intervals at 105% FTP with 2-minute recoveries between intervals.

The goal of Threshold workouts is to extend high power over greater duration so each iteration of this particular type of suffering will include more or longer work intervals than the version before it and the recovery valleys will shrink from training phase to training phase.

These intervals are also an ideal time to begin bridging the gap between power in an upright riding position and power in an aerodynamic position.

## VO2 Max Workouts

---

### VO2-W2

**50 seconds of pain**

This is 3x12-minute sets of 50 seconds all-out (125% FTP) followed closely by 50 seconds of rest where the less predictable spacing of efforts is meant to surprise riders & keep them attentive.

4 minutes of recovery separates each set of intervals.

The primary aim is to Improve maximum aerobic capacity, i.e. endurance that allows riders to work harder & longer with less sugar-expense and improved oxygen utilisation.

Secondarily, this strives to simultaneously challenge one's anaerobic work capacity leading to greater speed endurance, improved lactate processing & sprint capabilities.

---

### VO2-W3

**Sprint and hold**

This is 6 sets lasting almost 5 minutes each each consisting of 8x15 efforts at 125% FTP with less than restful "floats" for 15 seconds at 88% FTP.The floats grow to 30 seconds after every set of short VO2 Max efforts.Recoveries between sets are 5 minutes long.

The goal here is to improve both your aerobic efficiency and aerobic power.By working very hard for brief intervals and then only recovering for very short periods of time, these micro-intervals can be highly effective at improving your ability to sustain & repeat efforts well above FTP.This improved aerobic capacity & power can also raise your sustainable power and gradually increase your FTP.Additionally, you'll improve your ability to accelerate in minimal time and improvements in your mental capacity (i.e. toughness) are likely considering the necessary discomfort when repeating high-intensity bursts of power & speed.Very Important: Performing these intervals at 125% FTP assumes you can complete the intervals with few or no breaks. If you're frequently exiting intervals early, reduce the Workout Intensity to a repeatable power output.

### VO2-W6

**Elephants**

Elephants consists of 6x5-minute repeats at 108% FTP separated by 3-minute recovery valleys.

A sharp drop from VO2 Max power allows far greater time at an output well above your current sustainable power.

The intent is to cultivate greater muscular endurance and pain tolerance as your VO2 Max intervals become more & more similar to your key event.

Shoot for a cadence in the 85-95 rpm range.

### VO2-W7

**40/20**

This is a favourite workout of Jens Voight, so let's make those legs shout out.

It is a simple plan, two sets of five minute efforts. Each minute is made up of 40 seconds at Vo2max efforts followed by 20 seconds of rest. Keep the cadence low, around the 80 mark just to work those leg muscles really work.

Over-Unders help develop the ability to handle changes in pace while maintaining a high level of work. Think of pushing up a short rise before settling back into time trial mode.

By pushing above FTP briefly, you'll flood your muscles with metabolic byproducts bringing with them the desire to ease up, don't.

Hold that burn and relief will come gradually, all the while your muscles improve their abitliy to shuttle the excess lactate as your mind learns to tolerate the additional discomfort and eventually minimize it.

Try to keep your cadence in the 85-95 rpm range whether in the valleys or on the way up/down.

### VO2-W8

**Red Lake**

Red Lake is 5x5-minute repeats at 108% FTP separated by 5-minute recovery valleys.

A sharp drop from VO2 Max power allows far greater time at an output well above your current sustainable power.

The intent is to cultivate greater muscular endurance and pain tolerance as your VO2 Max intervals become more & more similar to your key event.

### VO2-W9

**Shortoff**

Shortoff consists of 2 sets of 3x2-minute VO2 Max intervals at 120% FTP.

Rest between intervals is 2 minutes long and rest between sets of intervals is 8 minutes long.

Reduce the Workout Intensity as necessary such that you can fully complete each of these 4-minute intervals, but never drop below 110% FTP.

You'll then probably use that same power reduction during alternate versions of this workout which increase each interval's duration.

VO2max repeats are all about increasing your aerobic capabilities & adaptations via work done at or very near your peak aerobic power output.

On the psychological side, they'll improve your ability to not only mentally tolerate work at this high output but repeat such efforts, frequently if necessary.

### VO2-W10

**South Twin**

South Twin is a VO2 Max taper/recovery workout and consists of 2 sets of 2x2-minute VO2 Max intervals at 125% FTP.

Extended rest between intervals is 4 minutes long and rest between sets of intervals is 8 minutes long.

As with most recovery workouts, the intent is to keep the intensity and ditch some of the volume & overall stress.

If you find that 3 of these intervals wipes you out, then resist the urge to poorly perform the fourth and final interval simply because it's there.

Similarly, if you're smoked after 2 intervals, bag the rest of the workout knowing that the rest is more important (and productive) than the stress today.

### VO2-W11

**40/20s**

Different spin on VO2-W7

A few options today so it is important to listen to your body when deciding what to do. Some time spent in the gym, or even taking a yoga or Pilates class, can be an ideal complement to the cycling training you are doing. If you have felt strong on the bike all week, the Bonus Session is a good choice but remember you have got a fairly tough ride tomorrow. If you are feeling
tired though, take an additional rest day

## Anaerobic Capacity Workouts

---

### AC-W9

**Monadnock**

Monadnock consists of 2 sets of 3x2-minute VO2max intervals at 130% FTP.

Rest between intervals is 4 minutes long and rest between sets of intervals is 8 minutes long.

Reduce the Workout Intensity as necessary such that you can fully complete each of these 4-minute intervals, but never drop below 110% FTP.

You'll then probably use that same power reduction during alternate versions of this workout which increase each interval's duration.

VO2max repeats are all about increasing your aerobic capabilities & adaptations via work done at or very near your peak aerobic power output.

On the psychological side, they'll improve your ability to not only mentally tolerate work at this high output but repeat such efforts, frequently if necessary.

### AC-W12

**Hawks Bill**

Hawk's Bill is 6 sets of 7x20s/15s Reduced Amplitude Billats where you'll spend 20 seconds at 125% FTP and then "float" for 15 seconds at 88% FTP.

Extended 30-second floats fall after each set of Billats and the entire workout offers a crack at almost 12 minutes at/near VO2 Max power.

5 minutes of recovery separate each set.

As with similar workouts, the goal is to improve both your aerobic efficiency and aerobic power.

By working very hard for brief intervals and then only recovering for very short periods of time, these micro intervals can be highly effective at improving your ability to sustain & repeat efforts well above FTP.

This improved aerobic capacity & power can also raise your sustainable power and gradually increase your FTP.

Additionally, you'll improve your ability to accelerate in minimal time and improvements in your mental capacity (i.e. toughness) are likely considering the necessary discomfort when repeating high-intensity bursts of power & speed.

Very Important: Performing these intervals at 125% FTP assumes you can complete the intervals with few or no breaks.

If you're frequently exiting intervals early, reduce the Workout Intensity to a repeatable power output.

But it’s gone on too long – and we had to respond. So, over a bottle of Real Pagne, legendary Directeur Sportif Grunter von Agony had a quiet word with a man named Ian Field. Ian, you may know, is an elite coach with Dig Deep Coaching, and a three-time (and current) British National Cyclocross Champion. After an evil laugh that lingered, he provided us a workout he uses to perform at the highest levels of the Cyclocross World Cup. “Don’t worry,” said Ian. “The Couchlandrians will enjoy half of it.” And so, we give you Half is Easy. It features a boat, two puppies, a cat, a hammock, an ocean view or two and a campfire beer. It also features officially licensed UCI footage from both men’s and women’s elite racing in MTB, Cyclocross, BMX and Road. Something for everyone, really. You won’t half enjoy it.

### AC-W16

**Apple Orchard**

Apple Orchard is 4 sets lasting 3.5 minutes each. Each interval consists of 6x15 efforts at 125% FTP with less than restful "floats" for 15 seconds at 88% FTP.

The floats grow to 30 seconds after every set of short VO2 Max efforts.

Recoveries between sets are 3 minutes long.

The primary goals here are still to improve both your aerobic efficiency & aerobic power, but by keeping the total work volume relatively low with fewer repeats, your body stands a better chance of absorbing the stress of previous, higher-stress training weeks.

### AC-W17

**Megantic**

Megantic is 4x5-minute race-like efforts beginning with a 30-second surge at 150% FTP and closely followed by 4 minutes of repeats where you're either working at 125% or "floating" at 88% FTP.

Each effort is separated by 5 minutes of recovery.

Combination intervals like this are aimed primarily at making your workouts more and more similar to your target events.

More specifically, the initial sprint is about high power & high muscle contribution/activation while the latter VO2 Max repeats target your aerobic power, oxygen uptake & pain tolerance.

Important: If the sprint segments are too severe, reduce the Workout Intensity during the sprints.

If you frequently skip Billats, reduce the Workout Intensity during the 15/15's.

### AC-W18

**Osceola**

Osceola is 2 sets of 3x1-minute VO2 Max intervals at 125% FTP and forms this Taper version of similar VO2max workouts.

Rest between intervals is 4 minutes long and rest between sets of intervals is 8 minutes long.

Tapering is all about high intensity but low levels of volume & fatigue, so pay attention to how you feel as this deceivingly short workout progresses.

If your fatigue mounts to a point where you aren't eager to attack the next 1-minute interval, skip it.

If you can't rally for the interval that follows that one, your day's done, son.

Taper workouts should leave you feeling fresh & ready to perform, not tired & demotivated.

### AC-W19

**English**

English is 2 sets of 7x60-seconds @ 127% FTP/50-second recoveries.

Each set is separated by 8 minutes of recovery.

One aim of high-intensity efforts is to increase the total number of muscle fibers available for recruitment and thus grow your capacity for greater power outputs.

Another goal is to improve your total muscular contribution and expand your muscular capabilities, both in terms of force production & endurance capacity.

And by performing small doses of high-intensity work, you'll lay the foundation for much longer VO2max intervals done at lower percentages of VO2max but still above FTP.

Strive for a higher than usual cadence, preferably over 100rpm.

Each effort is separated by 5 minutes of recovery.

Combination intervals like this are aimed primarily at making your workouts more & more similar to your target events.

More specifically, the initial sprint is about high power & high muscle contribution/activation while the latter RAB's target your aerobic power, oxygen uptake & pain tolerance.
